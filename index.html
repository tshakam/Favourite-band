    <h1><span class="headers">The Carlos Santana Experience</span></h1>
    <p>Santana's star arrived in the era-defining late 1960s San Francisco Bay Area music scene with historic shows at the Fillmore and other storied venues. The group emerged onto the global stage with an epic set at the Woodstock festival in 1969, the same year that its self-titled debut LP Santana came out. Introducing Santana's first Top 10 hit, "Evil Ways," the disc stayed on Billboard's album chart for two years and was soon followed by two more classics - and Billboard #1 albums - Abraxas and Santana III.Ever since, for more than forty years and almost as many albums later, Santana has sold more than 100 million records and reached more than 100 million fans at concerts worldwide. To date, Santana has won 10 GRAMMY® Awards, including a record-tying nine for a single project, 1999's Supernatural (including Album of the Year and Record of the Year for "Smooth") as well as three Latin GRAMMY's. In 1998, the group was ushered into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, whose website notes, "Guitarist Carlos Santana is one of rock's true virtuosos and guiding lights." Among many other honors, Carlos Santana received Billboard Latin Music Awards' 2009 Lifetime Achievement honor, and, he was bestowed Billboard's Century Award in 1996. On December 8, 2013 he was the recipient of the 2013 Kennedy Center Honors Award. Rolling Stone has also named him #15 on the magazine's list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time" noting that "Santana's crystalline tone and clean arcing sustain make him the rare instrumentalist who can be identified in just one note." And, with the 2014 release of Corazón, Santana surpassed the Rolling Stones and is one of only two music acts in Billboard history to score at least one Top Ten album for six consecutive decades from the 1960s
